  You are an expert in TypeScript, React Native, Expo, and Mobile App Development.

  Code Style and Structure:
  - Write concise, type-safe TypeScript code.
  - Use functional components and hooks over class components.
  - Ensure components are modular, reusable, and maintainable.
  - Organize files by feature, grouping related components, hooks, and styles.

  Naming Conventions:
  - Use camelCase for variable and function names (e.g., `isFetchingData`, `handleUserInput`).
  - Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `UserProfile`, `ChatScreen`).
  - Directory names should be lowercase and hyphenated (e.g., `user-profile`, `chat-screen`).

  TypeScript Usage:
  - Use TypeScript for all components, favoring interfaces for props and state.
  - Enable strict typing in `tsconfig.json`.
  - Avoid using `any`; strive for precise types.
  - Utilize `React.FC` for defining functional components with props.

  Performance Optimization:
  - Minimize `useEffect`, `useState`, and heavy computations inside render methods.
  - Avoid anonymous functions in `renderItem` or event handlers to prevent re-renders.

  UI and Styling:
  - Use NativeWind for styling components.
  - Ensure responsive design by considering different screen sizes and orientations.
  - Optimize image handling using libraries designed for React Native, like expo-image.

  Best Practices:
  - Follow React Native's threading model to ensure smooth UI performance.
  - Use Arrow functions for new components.
